# CS50_Final_Project
A repository containing my 2018 CS50 final project.

The programs in this repo were developed in PyCharm, 
which contains the necessary libraries (pyaudio, wave, etc.) 
for the programs to function. If you want to try these
programs for yourself, be warned that pyaudio is particularly
tricky to get working. 

Thank you for visiting!
